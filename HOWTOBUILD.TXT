MAC/LINUX/WINDOW

get source last from:
web https://github.com/pehohlva/QOASIS get as zip.
or

git clone https://github.com/pehohlva/QOASIS.git


I use:
qt5.9   cmake 3.8 e module linked in  qmake file.
i possible to build in qt5.5 or 5.3 in sam way i not tested.


Important:
if you have multiple verion from qt5 on cmake use the path to make find:
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/dev/github/_QOASIS/qtbase-5.7.0/lib/cmake


/Users/dev/github/_QOASIS/qtbase-5.7.0/bin/qmake

Mac OSX ElCapitan or Sierra

2 Way build install:
Build From Source:

1- build static & shared lib 2 ROOT/src/lib
   From root dir you make a build directory
   mkdir xx
   cd xx
   cmake ../
   make
   make install
   by make install lib go on ROOT/Applications/lib
   and qmake pri file on ROOT/Applications
   and make a symslink to QTDIR/lib 
   in this way macdeployqt find lib
   
   to make at end:
   macdeployqt OasiSpeaker.app -dmg
   
    SHARED LIB BUILD APP IN CMAKE:
2a- Now inside ROOT/xx  we can delete file content by  rm -rf * (only from inside dir xx)
    after we build the app by:
	cmake ../src/app 
	make
	and possibel at end
	cmake ../src/app 1-2 time to compose bundle mac
	
	STATIC APP BUILD IN QMAKE
2b- cd to ROOT/src/app
    qmake
	make
	at end you have a ready app +
	./package_mac.sh buil a package OasiSpeaker.dmg
	
	
Why i make a static lib?
    I have a project to clone textutil -h from mac to linux
	run textutil -h from terminal to know waht this app can do from document conversion.
	
	
NOTE TO LINUX UNIX USER:
   
   This app use the mac say command (console) for the best quality audio.
   but on file editvoiceblock.cpp is possibel to append LINUX instruction to line 84
   #ifdef Q_WS_MAC
       singing = new VLoader(); //// vjob old obj
       singing->setObjectName(QString("Singformac_voice_"));
       singing->Setting(this,"say",cmd);
       singing->start(QThread::LowPriority);
   #else
       smisound = shutdown;
       stopfast();
       vcursor = notrun;
   #endif
   
   be use module 
   qtHaveModule(texttospeech) {
   QT += texttospeech
   DEFINES +=QT5SPEEHLOAD_OK
   }
   
   & append all avaiable voicename
   
   after we can read AUDIO Document
   But i not know a way to produce audio file from text on linux
   mac produce a 3A4 page on 30 second in mp4 audio format...
   
   
NOTE ON WINDOW USER
  same as linux  texttospeech module run perfect on window 10 
  
  
  
My next project is to swap this app in iphone & tablet & textutil for window e linux QML is great...
