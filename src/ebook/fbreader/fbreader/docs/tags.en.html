<h2><center>Book Tags in FBReader</center></h2>

<h3>What is a book tag?</h3>
<p>As of version 0.8.16 FBReader supports book tags.  This feature allows for organizing libraries
in a way more convenient for the end user.</p>

<p>A tag is just a text string, set of possible tags is not pre-defined, which means that the user
can add a new tag at any moment.  Each book may have zero or more tags.  These tags are listed in
the book information dialog as a list.</p>

<p>For example, if the dialog shows &ldquo;Science Fiction, Fantasy, New&rdquo;, it means that the
book has three tags &mdash; &ldquo;Science Fiction&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; and
&ldquo;New&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Tag name <b>must not</b> contain a comma symbol (&ldquo;,&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Spaces and tab symbols at the beginning and the end of a tag name are ignored.</p>

<!-- Multi-level vs hierarchical: what would be more appropriate? -->
<h3>Hierarchical tags.</h3>
<p>If tag name contains &ldquo;/&rdquo;, then this tag is considered hierarchical.  For example, a
string &ldquo;Fiction/SF &amp; Fantasy/Fantasy&rdquo; will be interpreted as subtag
&ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; of subtag &ldquo;SF &amp; Fantasy&rdquo; of top level tag
&ldquo;Fiction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tag name <b>must not</b> contain a slash symbol (&ldquo;/&rdquo;).</p>

<!-- double check with the native speaker -->
<h3>Library Tree View.</h3>
<p>The book library is shown as a tree. The first levels of the tree are representing book tags
hierarchy. The next levels are for the book author, for the book series (if present), and for the
book title correspondently.</p>

<p>If a book has several tags, it will be shown in several branches.</p>

<p>If a book has no tags, it will be shown in the branch called &ldquo;Books with no Tags&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Additionaly, all books can be found in the branch called &ldquo;All Books&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Library Tree View Settings.</h3>

<p>If you open the preferences dialog and select &ldquo;Library&rdquo; tab, you can see two
options:<dl>
    <dt>&ldquo;Show Tag Hierarchies&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>By clearing this option you tell FBReader to show traditional tree with not tags</dd>
    <dt>&ldquo;Show All Books Branch&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>By clearing this option you tell FBReader not to show the branch called &ldquo;All
    Books&rdquo;</dd>
</dl>

<!-- check "locations of the book" vs "book locations" -->
<h3>Book Highlighting in the Library View Tree.</h3>
<p>When you open library tree view, the book you are currently reading will be shown and highlighted
in the tree.  While all locations of the book are highlighted, you will see the last appearance of
the book in the view.  You can go through all the locations using &ldquo;Find
Previous&rdquo;/&ldquo;Find Next&rdquo; buttons.</p>

<!-- As of version - how good this is? -->
<h3>Automatic Extraction of Tags.</h3>
<p>Certain book formats support tags natively.  As of version 0.8.16, FBReader can extract tags from
books in <code>fb2</code>, <code>mobipocket</code> and <code>oeb/epub</code> formats.  Tags may be defined by the user.
The following sections describe what operations can be performed on tags.</p>

<h3>Setting/Changing Tags for a Book.</h3>
<p>In order to set or to change list of tags for a book, open book information dialog, select
&ldquo;Tags&rdquo; tab and edit the list.  Tag names will only be changed for the book you update.
If you add a new tag, it will be automatically shown in the tree.  If you delete a tag that only
this book had, the tag will automatically disappear from the tree.</p>

<h3>Changing a Tag Hierarchy.</h3>
<p>If you would like to change a tag hierarchy, you can do it in the library tree view: navigate to the tag
that corresponds to the hierarchy you would like to change and click on the bulb that is to the right of the tag name.</p>

<p>In the opened dialog you can:<ul>
<li>Change the tag name</li>
<p>A tag name <b>must not</b> contain a comma: if you put it there by mistake, the name won't be
changed.</p>
<p>Empty name won't be changed either.</p>
<p>If you use &ldquo;/&rdquo; in the tag name, it will be considered as a separator for a
hierarchical tag.</p>
<p>Spaces and tab symbols will be removed from the beginning and the end of the tag name.</p>
<p>If a tag you are editing, has subtags, in the dialog you can specify that the operation should
affect subtags as well; that is control by &ldquo;With Subtags&rdquo; checkbox.</p>

<li>Cloning a tag</li>
<p>Select the radiobutton named &ldquo;Clone Tag&rdquo; and specify the name of the new tag. If the tag you
specified already exists, the books from with the current tags will be tagged with the new tag.</p>

<li>Merging two tag hierarchies</li>
<p>If the tag name you specify already exists, this won't be considered as an error: renaming or
cloning will be performed as usually.  As result, the corresponding branches of tag hierarchy will
be merged.  Since this operation seems to be quite useful, instead of entering a tag name manually,
you can just select it from the list.</p>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Deleting Tags.</h3>
<p>If you would like to delete a tag, click on a minus sign right to the tag name.  You will need to
confirm the operation when a dialog appears.  If you confirm the operations, the specified tag will
be removed from all books that had this tag.  <b>Note</b>: no books will be removed by this operation.</p>

<p>If the tag you are about to delete has subtags, the confirmation dialog will have three buttons
&mdash; &ldquo;This Only&rdquo;, &ldquo;With Subtags&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo;.  If you click
on the &ldquo;This Only&rdquo;, exactly the selected tag will be removed (if there are any books tagged by it).  If
you click on the &ldquo;With Subtags&rdquo;, then the selected tag and all its subtags will be removed and the
corresponding branch will not be shown in the tree.</p>

<p>For example, if you have books tagged as &ldquo;Fiction&rdquo; and books tagged as
&ldquo;Fiction/Horror&rdquo;, and you try to delete tag &ldquo;Fiction&rdquo;, you can<ul>
<li>Click on &ldquo;This Only&rdquo;</li>
<p>In this case, the tag &ldquo;Fiction&rdquo; will disappear from the tag list of books that were
tagged with it, while tag &ldquo;Fiction/Horror&rdquo; will remain. And while both tags will be shown
in the library tree view, the first one will have no books.</p>
<li>Click on &ldquo;With Subtags&rdquo;</li> 
<p>In this case both tags &ldquo;Fiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fiction/Horror&rdquo; will be removed
from the books that were tagged with them and the whole subtree that started with
&ldquo;Fiction&rdquo; will not be shown.</p>
