  What is automatic configuration file saving and why it's safe
  -->
<h3><center>Configuration Files</center></h3>

<h4>Configuration Files</h4>

<p>FBReader keeps several kinds of configuration data:<ul>
  <li>options that affect application behaviour (places to look for books for, scrolling, keybindings, etc&hellip;)</li>
  <li>options that specifically related to the way how the text is shown</li>
  <li>current state of the program (current and previously read books, positions in each of them)</li>
  <li>information about books, both automatically detected and manually added by the user</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Automatic Saving</h4>
<p>As of version 0.7.3e FBReader supports automatic configuration data saving: every <i>XX</i>
seconds FBReader tries to save any changed configuration data.  You can control this feature by
opening "Preferences" dialog and going to "Config" page.  There are two options there:<dl>
  <dt>Save State Automatically</dt>
  <dd>controls whether this option is enabled.  The default value is 'enabled'.</dd>
  <dt>Timeout between Savings, seconds</dt>
  <dd>controls how often FBReader check if there is anything to save.  The default value is 5 seconds.</dd>
</dl></p>

<p>Cover thing 1: FBReader saves the only changed configuration files.  If nothing was changed,
nothing is written.  <b>Note</b>: if you scroll through a book, then the state of the application is
changing and, as result, that particular information will be stored.

<p>Cover thing 2: auto saving and jffs.
