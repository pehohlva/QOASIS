/** @brief Read the XML tree of the content of an ODT file.
 *
 * The OdtReader is used to traverse (read) the contents of an ODT
 * file using an XML stream reader.  For every XML element that the
 * reading process comes across it will call a specific function in a
 * backend class: @see OdtReaderBackend.
 *
 * Before the reading process is started the ODT file will be
 * analyzed to collect some data that may be needed during the
 * read: metadata, manifest and styles are examples of this. This
 * data is stored in the so called reading context, which is kept in
 * an instance of the OdfReaderContext class.
 *
 * The context will be passed around to the backend in every call to a
 * backend callback function.
 *
 * In addition to the pre-analyzed data from the ODT file, the context
 * can be used to keep track of data that is used in the backend
 * processing such as internal links, lists of embedded data such as
 * pictures.
