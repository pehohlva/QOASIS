Primary goal: Unify handling of charts in Calligra: filters and shape
Later goal:   Simplify the move to the new KdCharts and perhaps other backends


Part I: Move the charts to libodf2

Preparations
 * Move to better places and do some cleanups				Done
    + NumberFormatParser --> libmso					done
    + Charting -> KoChart,  --> libodf2					done
 * Change the namespace to KoChart					Done

Refactoring
 * Separate the definition of DrawingMLTheme from the ThemesReader.	Done
    + Move the data definitions into its own .h file. 			done
    + Only include the Theme definitions where the reader is not needed done
 * Make ChartExport into a base class and make inherited classes in:	Done
    + Move baseclass to libodf2    	       		 	 	done
    + subclass in sheets/xlsx	   	  - using the DrawingMLTheme	done
    + subclass in sheets/excel/sidewinder - using the 2003palette	LATER(*)

Test
 * Convert all the test documents and check that the output is the same ----
   as before.
    + Download the test documents (checkout the repo)			....
    + Create a script that does the conversion				....
    + Create a script that does the comparison				....


(*) The palette is far too deeply ingrained in all of the chart writer to be
    easily separated.  And perhaps this is something we could use in the chart
    shape itself? We have wanted to provide support for chart themes for some
    time now.


Milestone 1: separating useful parts into a library
----------------------------------------------------------------

Part II: Enhance the chart storage and use it in the chart shape

Enhancements of KoChart::Chart and the subclasses
 * Separate into separate files						----
 * Also read ODF (get from the ChartShape)				----
 * ...

Start using KoChart in ChartShape
 * Create a backend API and move KDChart into a backend subdirectory	----
 * Use the storage classes  	 	      				----


Milestone 2: Share common definitions and some data classes between all usages
	     of charts.
----------------------------------------------------------------


Other stuff to do, but not part of this plan:

 * Move XlsxChartReader to libmsooxml. (it's used in docx and pptx)
 * Move XlsxChartExport to libmsooxml. (it's used in docx and pptx)
