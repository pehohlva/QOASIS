# - Try to find the Qt4 binding of the Poppler library
# Once done this will define  PopplerQt5
#
#  POPPLER_QT5_FOUND - system has poppler-qt5
#  POPPLER_QT5_INCLUDE_DIR - the poppler-qt5 include directory
#  POPPLER_QT5_LIBRARIES - Link these to use poppler-qt5
#  POPPLER_QT5_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using poppler-qt5
#

# use pkg-config to get the directories and then use these values
# in the find_path() and find_library() calls
